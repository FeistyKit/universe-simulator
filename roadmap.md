# My roadmap for the project

- ~~put comments to explain every part of the project~~ DONE
  - the code is hard to read right now, and soon it will get really confusing

  - having to explain my code will lead to me refining it and fixing dumb errors or weird variable names

- potentially do some refactoring in regards to my imported type conventions

- ~~GUI thread~~ Got the *thread* running, just have to do the GUI itself :p

- The GUI Itself
  - Widgets

  - Requires two clicks to place down bodies so motion can be implemented.

  - Click and drag(?)

- fix softening and gravity constants

- saving and loading from files

- think of something to with delta timing

- ~~put processing of inputs to gui thread~~ Decided against.

- decide whether or not to keep the "clickregistered" enum

- update comments so they're a bit more professional

- Add more widgets
