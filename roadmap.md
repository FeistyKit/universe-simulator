# My roadmap for the project

- put comments to explain every part of the project
  - the code is hard to read right now, and soon it will get really confusing
  
  - having to explain my code will lead to me refining it and fixing dumb errors or weird variable names

- potentially do some refactoring in regards to my imported type conventions

- GUI thread

- fix softening and gravity constants

- saving and loading from files

- think of something to with delta timing

- put processing of inputs to gui thread

- decide whether or not to keep the "clickregistered" enum
